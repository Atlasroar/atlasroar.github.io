[Administrators](Project:Administrators "wikilink") can **protect** and
**unprotect** pages, including ones that do not exist. Protection of a
page or image usually means that a non-admin cannot modify it.

The majority of pages on all Wikia should remain publicly editable, and
**not protected**. Pages may, however, be temporarily or permanently
protected for legal reasons (for example, license texts should not be
changed) or in cases of extreme vandalism or edit warring or abusive
re-creation.

## Uses

- Protecting highly vandalised pages, such as the [](Main_Page.md) on large wikis.
- Maintaining the integrity of the site's logo and favicon.
- Maintaining the integrity of key
  [copyright](Project:copyrights "wikilink") and license pages.
- Preventing repeatedly created vandal or spam pages from creation. See
  [Special:Protectedtitles](Special:Protectedtitles "wikilink")
- Protecting the interface and system messages in the MediaWiki
  namespace (these are protected automatically)

A **temporary** protection is used for:

- Enforcing a "cool down" period to stop an "edit war", upon request.
- Protecting a page or image that has been a recent target of
  *persistent* vandalism or *persistent* edits by a banned user.

There is no need to protect personal .css and .js pages like
user/monobook.css or user/cologneblue.js. Only the accounts associated
with these pages (and admins) are able to edit them. (For more
information on using these pages, see [Help:User
style](Help:User_style "wikilink"))

## Usage

Most pages and images are unprotected by default, only the site logo and
favicons are automatically protected. You can protect editing, moving,
or both by checking or unchecking the **Unlock move permissions
selection box**.

- **(default)** means any user, whether logged in or anonymous, can edit
  or move the page.
- **Block unregistered users**, or semi-protected, means anonymous users
  and new accounts less than 4 days old cannot edit and/or move pages.
- **Sysops only**, or fully-protected, means only administrators may
  edit and/or move the page.

Pages can also be cascade protected, this will cause all images, pages,
or templates transcluded onto the page to be fully protected, even if
the main article is only semi-protected.

## Rules

1.  Do not make the common mistake of protecting pages unnecessarily.
    For example, do not protect a page simply because it is the Main
    Page.
2.  Do not [edit](Help:Editing "wikilink") a temporarily protected page
    except to add a notice explaining the page is protected.
3.  Do not protect a page you are involved in an edit dispute over.
    Admin powers are not editor privileges - admins should only act as
    servants to the user community at large.
4.  Avoid favoring one version of the article over another, unless one
    version is vandalism.
5.  Temporarily protected pages should not be left protected for very
    long.
6.  Talk pages and user talk pages are not protected except in extreme
    circumstances.
7.  The protection of a page on any particular version is not meant to
    express support for that version and requests should therefore not
    be made that the protected version be reverted to a different one.

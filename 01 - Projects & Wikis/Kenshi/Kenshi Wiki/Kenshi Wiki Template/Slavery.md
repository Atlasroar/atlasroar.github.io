![](Servantbeat.png "Servantbeat.png") Slavery has always been a
controversial industry; wars have been fought over the usage and
regulation of slavery. The practice of slavery is particularly favored
by [United Cities](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink"), [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md) and the
[Reavers](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Reavers.md "wikilink"), and detested by
[Anti-Slavers](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Anti-Slavers.md "wikilink"), [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Rebel_Swordsmen.md) and
[Mongrel](Mongrel_(Faction).md "wikilink").

Kenshi is an unforgiving world. If you are too weak to protect yourself,
someone will take advantage of that. Therefore, **Slavery** is a huge
industry in Kenshi. Slavers are always looking for unconscious
characters to enslave and make a profit out of.

### Being Enslaved

Players who have been enslaved will first have their
[Weapons](Weapons.md "wikilink") confiscated and have some of their armour
replaced with [Prisoner Shackles](Prisoner_Shackles.md "wikilink"). If the
character is unable to wear shoes, they will be given [](Hive_Prisoner_Shackles.md). If they regain
consciousness, their captors may allow them to follow. Otherwise, slaves
are carried by a member of the slaver squad. Players will have the rest
of their [Equipment](Equipment.md "wikilink") confiscated as well, but
depending on the faction, that may not occur until they reach a town or
slave camp.![](Slavery.jpg "Slavery.jpg")

Players might also be enslaved if they have been imprisoned in [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md) or [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md). If players desire to be enslaved,
they can most readily achieve this state by getting in a [](Prisoner_Cage.md) in a slave shop.

When enslaved, player characters have everything on their
[Jobs](Jobs.md "wikilink") list replaced with a single "Obedient Slave"
job. Removing this job will result in that character being labeled an
"escaped slave," although this may not be immediate. The Obedient Slave
job causes characters to follow their master's orders, whether they are
to farm, labour, or to fight in their defense.

There are at times however, that this job may cause the enslaved
character to attempt and steal any weapon that is nearby either inside a
nearby unlocked chest or at a downed character, which risks them being
attacked for thievery if discovered attempting to do so.

### Escaping and Hiding

![](Slavery-PortNorth.jpg "Slavery-PortNorth.jpg") Escaping slavery can
be as easy as finding the right moment or as hard as having to stage an
elaborate plan. Smaller slave sites like Holy Mines have plenty of gaps
in security, and if bandits attack, most of the guards will run off to
fight them. If you don't wish to wait for that moment, however, there
are plenty of other ways to ensure your escape. Even if you make a clean
getaway without alerting the guards, you'll be branded an Ex-Slave for a
while, causing hostility to any pro-slavery faction characters who
notice you. Keep an eye on your "Looks like a Slave" percentage in your
inventory window to see how likely someone is to identify you. It is not
recommended to try and escape while you are in-transit unless there's an
attack or something to distract the guards. Better to be patient and
plan carefully to avoid a slow and painful death out in the desert.

The most important skills to aid in your escape will be
Stealth, Assassination, and Thievery. Lockpicking is important too, but
it's not usually time-sensitive, so you can keep trying until you get
it. To start, unlock your shackles. Keep them on while the guards are
around, even in your cage, or they'll immediately attack you, but when
you need to sneak, fight, or run, take them off as they lower your
stealth and movement skills. The guards won't re-lock them unless you're
caught, so it's good to do that as soon as possible.

Secondly, if you think you'll have to fight your way out, plan ahead.
Knock guards out with Assassination, and take their weapon and drop it,
and take off all their armor- they won't pick them up or put them back
on. This is easiest to do while they're sleeping, of course, but even if
you're out working, don't hesitate to attack a lone guard. As long as
the knockout is successful, and none of the other guards saw it, you
won't get attacked. This is easiest at Rebirth because of how spread out
they are, but at smaller outposts, guards tend to run around pretty
quickly, so nighttime is your only friend there.
![](Shekhunted.png "Shekhunted.png")

Finally, your greatest tool for making your escape will be the disguise.
Steal a guard's armor and equip all of it (keep the shackles, until
you're ready to run). They won't take it or give you new slave clothes
unless you're caught without the shackles on. Once things quiet down and
guards stop running around, make for the exit. Keep to the side and stay
as far from other guards' line of sight as possible. Sneak, if you can,
it doesn't negatively affect your disguise, but with the guards' armor,
you will be slow, and your stealth rating might be zero anyway. At the
gate, they usually have two rows of guards: one in the back and 2-4 in
the front. Knock out the one in the back and try to leave out the side.

If you're having trouble, especially if you're in a big city, it might
be necessary to cause a distraction. Have another character fight the
guards at the gate or bring a hostile creature or release the other
slaves and escape while the guards chase them down (be warned- they go
down quickly).![](Arrested_slave.png "Arrested_slave.png") [](Samurai_Police.md).\]\]

After you escape, you'll need to lay low for several game-days before
the faction stops being hostile (unless you have an already low rating
or bounty with them), so change your clothes and hair until the "Looks
like a Slave" stat in the inventory window reads 1%.

Alternatively, if you are not on bad terms with
[Anti-Slavers](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Anti-Slavers.md "wikilink"), [Grey](Grey.md "wikilink") can
immediately clear your status as a slave upon talking to him. However,
unless you have a major level in toughness and athletic, it might be
unfeasible to look for him usually.

### [Slave Recruits](Slave_Recruits.md "wikilink")

Depending on their personality, [slaves](Slave.md "wikilink") will either
welcome the chance to escape or fearfully insist on remaining in their
cage. Freed slaves will likely ally with the player for a time,
following them around. Allies are visible as a green dot on the map.
After leading an ally far enough away from their masters, the rescued
slave may choose to join the player or separate and run away.

A slave usually will not join the player if the slave has combined stats
from [Strength](Strength.md "wikilink"), [Dexterity](Dexterity.md "wikilink")
and [Toughness](Toughness.md "wikilink") of over 75. (Some rare cases may
allow some NPCs to skip this tag)

### Enslaving Characters

Players cannot own their own slaves. Slaves purchased from slavers will
become allies and will either join the player as a [](Slave_Recruits.md) or escape at the first chance they
get.

Players can earn a small sum of money by bringing characters to slavers.
Captured characters can be handed over directly to a slave master
through dialogue or by putting them in a [](Prisoner_Cage.md). If players are carrying a
[Bounty](Bounty.md "wikilink") wanted by the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md), they can earn their reward by placing
their bounty in a prisoner cage at a location controlled by the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Slave_Traders.md).

Characters who were sold into slavery by the player will likely remember
that fact and will not be grateful to be purchased or freed by the
player. However, if you were to pick up an unconscious character (Not
kidnap) and drop them on the ground near a slaver they would have no
idea that you were responsible for their capture.

## Factions

These [Factions](Factions.md "wikilink") will enslave characters.

### Manhunters

> The [Manhunters](Manhunters.md "wikilink") are a minor faction which
> patrol United Cities territory in search of escaped slaves. If they
> encounter characters which they think are weaker than them regardless
> of how they look (unless they are surrounded by hired mercenary or
> nearby United Cities/Traders Guild enforcers), they will likely
> attempt to down and capture them as well. They sell their slaves to
> the Slave Traders.

### Reavers

> The [Reavers](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Reavers.md "wikilink") are a minor faction found in
> [Stobe's Garden](Stobe's_Garden.md "wikilink"), [](The_Crags.md), and [](The_Outlands.md). They can be found patrolling the
> surrounding [zones](:Category:Zones "wikilink") as well. Reavers have
> armed slaves called [Reaver Slave](Reaver_Slave.md "wikilink") which are
> taken on patrols. However, Reavers still disarm player characters
> while enslaving them.

### Slave Hunters

> [Slave Hunters](Slave_Hunters.md "wikilink") are a minor faction also
> found in United Cities territory. They're essentially just a weaker
> version of the Manhunters. Unlike Manhunters, they disregard if the
> characters are surrounded by hired mercenary and will attack the group
> if they decided the characters are weaker than them.

### Slave Traders

> [Slave Traders](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Slave_Traders.md "wikilink") is the slave owning branch
> of the United Cities. They control slave farms and camps where they
> work slaves mercilessly. If players are on good or neutral terms with
> the Slave Traders, they can purchase slaves from slave shops in those
> locations as well as in slave markets.

### The Holy Nation

> [The Holy Nation](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md "wikilink") enslaves characters whom
> they consider in need of redemption. These characters are criminals or
> characters of organic non-[Human](Human.md "wikilink") races. These
> slaves are brought to [Holy Mines](Holy_Mines.md "wikilink") and
> [Rebirth](Rebirth.md "wikilink"), where they will work at a [](Stone_Mine.md) until they die (or escape). Because this
> slavery is for religious purposes and not economic, The Holy Nation
> will not trade slaves. Players can sell characters to Rebirth to make
> a small sum of money. (Note: The guards in rebirth have no repair kits
> so any Skeleton unfortunate enough to be enslaved will need to be
> careful not to take damage. Lore-wise they were not supposed to be
> captured.)

### United Cities

> The economy of the [United Cities](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink") relies
> heavily on slave labour. Players in a United Cities cage can be
> enslaved by the Slave Traders and taken out of town to a slave camp.

## Locations

These [locations](:Category:Locations "wikilink") are places which hold
and work slaves. These locations can be
[overtaken](Town_Overrides.md "wikilink") or destroyed if the player [](World_States.md) the correct characters.

### Reavers

- [Ark](Ark.md "wikilink")
- [Reaver Camp](Reaver_Camp.md "wikilink")

### The Holy Nation

- [Holy Mines](Holy_Mines.md "wikilink")
- [Rebirth](Rebirth.md "wikilink")

### Slave Traders

- [Eyesocket](Eyesocket.md "wikilink")
- [Slave Farm](Slave_Farm.md "wikilink")
- [Slave Farm South](Slave_Farm_South.md "wikilink")
- [Slave Markets](Slave_Markets.md "wikilink")
- [South Stone Camp](South_Stone_Camp.md "wikilink")
- [Stone Camp](Stone_Camp.md "wikilink")

As stated above, characters can also be imprisoned by police in any town
controlled by [United Cities](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink") or [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md).

## Slave Traders

![](Kenshiguardslave.jpg "Kenshiguardslave.jpg").\]\]

Slave Traders are NPCs. They will not attack the player as long as the
organization they're a part of isn't currently hostile towards the
player. However, if a player-controlled unit goes unconscious close to
them, they can heal them and take them to any nearby slave-based
outpost, where the unit will be forced to work. If the unit is
unconscious, it will be taken first to a cage while healing. Then a
slaver will come to the unit and take them to work.

Slave Traders will then watch the unit move and work and will taunt it
and remind it of its duty. At night, the slave will be taken back to a
cage, where he can try to unlock or destroy his shackles.

From time to time, some slavers will come to the camp and buy or rent
slaves, including the player's unit, which will now follow the caravan
for a while, then sometimes returning to the cage.

Slave Traders caravans can also bring new slaves, like bandits, and warn
everyone that non-workers will be brought to the furnace.

If the player tries to run away, he won't be able to run at full speed
because of [shackles](Prisoner_Shackles.md "wikilink"), will be called a
runner and marked as an escaped slave, and will be attacked by everyone.

If the character talks to the slave monger in a slave trader group, it
is possible to buy slaves from them, but the slaves will not do any work
other than to follow the player (unless they don't decide to join
immediately upon purchase). If they do follow the player (marked as
green dots, "allies") former slaves might join a player at a later time
or leave them altogether.
